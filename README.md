# EYSIP
This repo contains the internship work done under EYSIP. We tried to create a lightweight autonomous pipleine by replacing a real LiDAR with a virtual one and localized the bot using a aruco marker. We created two systems one using various algorithms already available on OpenCV and other using SAM (ViT-L SAM model).
